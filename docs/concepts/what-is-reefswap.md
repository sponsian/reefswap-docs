## Protocol, Interface, Labs

To begin, we should make clear the distinctions between the different areas of "ReefSwap", some of which may confuse new users.

- **Reef Technology Ltd**: The company which developed the ReefSwap protocol, along with the web interface.
- **The ReefSwawp Protocol**: A suite of persistent, non-upgradable smart contracts that together create an automated market maker, a protocol that facilitates peer-to-peer market making and swapping of ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **The ReefSwap Interface**: A web interface that allows for easy interaction with the ReefSwap protocol. The interface is only one of many ways one may interact with the ReefSwap protocol.
- **ReefSwap Governance**: A potential, future governance system for governing the ReefSwap Protocol, enabled by a token.
